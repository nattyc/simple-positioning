#simple-positioning
==================

Bower package containing mixins for wrangling elements around on the page.

Run `bower install simple-positioning --save` to download the scss file.

This file should be sass flavor agnostic so I haven't included any Sass dependencies here.

Don't forget your `@import 'simple-positioning'` in your main sass file!
